# Abell Branding üíÖüèº

In this directory, you will find the different versions of Abell logos.

## Logos

### Plain Logo

It's better to use this in icons since it takes full canvas space and would appear larger.

<img width="150" alt="Plain Abell Logo" src="./abell-logo.png" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<img width="100" alt="Plain Abell Logo" src="./abell-logo.png" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<img width="50" alt="Plain Abell Logo" src="./abell-logo.png" />


### With Shadow

You will see this being used in Abell's documentation site, and main readme of Abell.

You can use this or the plain logo depending on whichever looks nice

<img width="150" alt="Abell Logo with Shadow" src="./abell-logo-shadow.png" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<img width="100" alt="Abell Logo with Shadow" src="./abell-logo-shadow.png" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<img width="50" alt="Abell Logo with Shadow" src="./abell-logo-shadow.png" />


### Light Logo

> **Note**
> 
> Generally its better to avoid using this since it completely changes the brand colors. 

There might be places where backgrounds are greyish blue which makes the other logos disappear and adding a background compromises the aesthetics.

E.g. This is used as an emoji in our discord channel because discord has gray theme.

<img width="150" alt="Abell Logo with Shadow" src="./abell-logo-light.png" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<img width="100" alt="Abell Logo with Shadow" src="./abell-logo-light.png" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<img width="50" alt="Abell Logo with Shadow" src="./abell-logo-light.png" />
