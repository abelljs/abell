## üèÉüèΩ Running Projects Locally

> **Note**
>
> All commands are supposed to be executed from the root of the monorepo.

The monorepo includes 3 packages and a playground directory where every example is treated as a monorepo package.

`docs` and all the `playground/**` examples use the local version from `abell` directory.

- ### `docs`

  ```sh
  pnpm docs:dev # dev server
  pnpm docs:generate # build
  ```

- ### `abell`

  #### Dev Server

  This will run `nodemon` command, watch over the changes in abell and rebuild the abell package for any change.

  ```sh
  pnpm abell
  ```


  You can then run any of the playground examples with `pnpm --filter <example-name> dev|generate`
  ```sh
  pnpm --filter basic dev # Runs dev-server of `playground/basic` example
  pnpm --filter basic generate # Runs build of `playground/basic` example
  ```

  > **Note**
  >
  > You will have to restart the dev-server of example when you make any change in `abell` package.


  #### Build

  ```sh
  pnpm abell:build
  ```

  #### Tests

  ```sh
  pnpm abell:test # To run on watch mode
  pnpm abell:test:once # To run test once
  ```

- ### `create-abell`

  ```sh
  pnpm create-abell
  ```

  This command creates abell project in `packages/create-abell/scaffold-dir/` (It will remove any older changes in that directory before creating new project)


## üß™ Running All Tests

```sh
pnpm test:once # Runs all tests
```
