## Abell v1.0.0-beta is now published on NPM ðŸš€

You can scaffold an Abell project using `npm create abell@latest`

or you can get started with a single `index.abell` file.

<Editor editorConfig={noConfigSetup} />

or Build your Abell Blog using [Abell's Starter Blog Template](https://github.com/abelljs/abell-starter-minima#readme).

## Why Abell?

There are 2 types of solutions for building static websites today,

### 1. Traditional template-engine-based Static-Site-Generators like Jekyll, Hugo, Hexo.

Static-Site-Generators like Jekyll, Hugo, Hexo, Eleventy, get their abstraction level really well. They are closer to HTML which gives a nice flexibility and can lower the learning curve. This is also how Abell v0 was built.

However a lot of these solutions (including Abell v0) either strugle to integrate with modern tools like MDX, JSX, TypeScript, etc, Cannot integrate at all, or have their own plugin system built around to extend their capabilities.

### 2. JavaScript-based solutions like Next.js, Astro.

On the other hand we have JavaScript-based or Bundler-based approach. Since you're primarily dealing with JavaScript here, and bundlers understand JavaScript really well, these tools have absolutely no problem integrating into modern JS ecosystem using plugins of the bundlers.

However these tools are often built on a higher abstraction and loose that closer-to-HTML feel that solutions like Jekyll and Hugo had.

### 3. ???

What if we pick nice things from both types of solutions and build something that is-

- Low-Level like Jekyll is
- Framework Agnostic and Integrates into modern ecosystem like Astro does
- has Smaller Learning Curve like Vanilla HTML

And this what Abell v1 tries to be.

## Abell is a <span className="highlight">Low-Level</span> Static-Site-Generator

Abell extends on top of vanilla HTML setup. You know CSS-in-JS, time of Node.JS/Bun-in-HTML!!

Its a code that might feel familiar even if you've never seen any Abell code before.

<Editor editorConfig={importExample} />

Fun Fact: Everything you know about Vanilla HTML still applies in this. How you add CSS, How you add meta tags, How you link client-JS, everything continues to work with some nice additional power of double curly braces.

### Low-Level on Routing!! Introducing `makeRoutes` API.

Abell takes a step-forward on low-level and allows you to opt-out of filesystem routing.

By default if you create `about.abell` file, it creates `/about` route. But you can use `makeRoutes` API in `entry.build.js` to opt-out of it and define route as a code.

<Editor editorConfig={routingExample} />

This combined with Vite's glob imports (`const allMarkdownContent = import.meta.glob('./*.md')`) lets you do some fun dynamic routing things like generating paths from markdown files.

Checkout how [Abell's Blog Template generates routes from markdown](https://github.com/abelljs/abell-starter-minima/blob/b5936e61f6d802181cd67cb7c58cbf18f43d2e29/entry.build.js#L6).

## Abell is a <span className="highlight">Framework Agnostic</span> Static-Site-Generator

You can checkout Abell's integration examples at [github.com/abelljs/integrations](https://github.com/abelljs/integrations).

You can in fact use Abell to turn your existing CSR apps to SSG apps in just 4 to 5 steps.

## Abell is a <span className="highlight">Vite Powered</span> Static-Site-Generator

Abell is built with a very little abstraction on top of vite. In fact, Abell (except its router) is majorly just a Vite plugin.

This allows Abell to integrate with rest of the ecosystem using existing Vite (and Vite-compatible Rollup) plugins.

### Abell Plugins?

What about Abell Plugins?? Well... Abell does not have a plugin system of its own at all!! It 100% relies on Vite plugins.

- How to use Sitemap? Ans: [vite-plugin-sitemap](https://github.com/jbaubree/vite-plugin-sitemap)
- How to use Markdown? Ans: [vite-plugin-md-to-html](https://github.com/saurabhdaware/vite-plugin-md-to-html)
- How to use MDX? Ans: [@mdx-js/rollup](https://abelljs.org/docs/plugins-and-integrations#with-mdx)

### Source Plugins?

`makeRoutes` API on the other hand removes the need of source-plugins because you can just make an API call and generate page content on the go (Having a file is not a requirement for Abell :D)

```ts
import index from './index.abell';
import layout from './layout.abell';

const response = await fetch('https://your-wordpress-site.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts').then((res) => res.json());
const posts = response.data;

export const makeRoutes = () => {
  return [
    {
      path: '/',
      render: () => index()
    }
    ...posts.map((post) => ({
      path: post.slug,
      render: () => layout(post.content.rendered)
    }))
  ]
}
```

We can definitely create more higher-level abstractions on top of this like a `getWordpressContent` utility. But not a requirement.

## What's Next?

For next few days, we're primarily working on things around the SSG itself. E.g. -

- Better Editor Tooling possibly using [Volar](https://volarjs.dev/) (There is Basic Syntax Highlighting and AutoComplete at [VSCode Abell Language Features](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=saurabh.abell-language-features) but it requires some more work)
- More Starter Templates
- More Integration Examples
- Bug Fixes

Interested in helping with any of these? Let us know on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/abelljs/abell/discussions).

### Phase 0. Traditional Template-Engine Based Static-Site-Generators

Abell v0 was aimed at becoming a simpler template engine that will seem familar to JavaScript developers. So something along the lines of Jekyll, Hugo, Hexo but on a simpler template called `.abell`

This is how it looked-

```abell
{{
  const myContent = require('./my-content.md');
  const markdownIt = require('markdown-it');
}}

<body>{{ markdownIt.render(myContent) }}</body>
```

Fun and simple right? This worked great until it didn't...

There were GitHub issues on supporting

- TypeScript
- Babel
- ESM imports
- MDX
- Plugins for New Syntaxes

Traditional template-engine-based Static-Site-Generators often couldn't integrate with modern JS ecosystem, struggled to integrate, or required a new plugin system of their own to integrate.

### Phase 1. Bundler-based Static-Site-Generator

Abell v1 is a second attempt of fixing the same problem. A simpler template engine that will look familiar to JavaScript developers but at the same time make it integrate into moderns JS ecosystem

### April, 2020

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) was the most popular way of building static-sites. Although for [Saurabh](https://twitter.com/saurabhdawaree), it was a bit difficult to grasp because it required learning React, GraphQL, and several things about Gatsby itself.

He tried for other solutions like Jekyll, Hugo, Hexo (EJS). They were amazing! Although there was some scope of simplifying the template engine for people coming from JavaScript.

Like "Why can't we have something that looks like this?", Saurabh Asked.

```abell
{{
  const myContent = require('./my-content.md');
  const markdownIt = require('markdown-it');
}}

<body>{{ markdownIt.render(myContent) }}</body>
```

And this was **Abell v0**. A simpler template engine, closer-to-jekyll static-site-generator for building blogs (shoutout pantharshit, prafulla-codes, and a lot of other github contributors to ).

This worked well until it didn't...

## What is Abell?

Well... Apart from being [a galaxy cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abell_2029) whose name happened to be available on NPM,

Abell is a [Low-Level](#abell-is-a-low-level-static-site-generator), [Framework Agnostic](), [Highly Flexible](), Static-Site-Generator [powered by Vite]()

## Abell is a <span className="highlight">Low-Level</span> Static-Site-Generator

Abell extends on top of vanilla HTML setup. You know CSS-in-JS, time of Node.JS/Bun-in-HTML!!

Just like you can start a web project with single `index.html`, you can start an Abell project with just one `index.abell` file without any configurations.

Everything you know about vanilla HTML setup, still applies here ^\_^

It takes inspirations from Jekyll, Hugo, Hexo
