# Plugins & Integrations

"How do I use Abell with ...?" This page will help you out!

Abell's low-level API and internally using Vite as a bundler, helps it integrate with other super cool tools in the ecosystem.

## With Vite Plugins

One way to use something with Abell is to find a Vite Plugin to do that.

Lets say you want to import markdown files in your abell project. You can use [vite-plugin-md-to-html](https://github.com/saurabhdaware/vite-plugin-md-to-html) or any markdown to html plugin of your choice.

<Editor editorConfig={markdownIntegration} />

## With MDX

Fun fact: This page that you're reading is being rendered from mdx. Similar to above example of markdown, It uses `vite-plugin-jsx-to-html` plugin in combination with rollup's official (vite compatible) `@mdx-js/rollup` plugin.

You can copy-paste this configuration and install plugins to start importing mdx files in your project.

```sh
npm i --save-dev vite-plugin-jsx-to-html @mdx-js/rollup
```

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'abell';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    mdx(), // Turns MDX to React Component (JSX)
    vitePluginJSXToHTML({ extensions: ['.mdx'] }) // Turns JSX to HTML
  ]
});
```

## With Frameworks

You can use combination of vite plugins and curly braces of Abell `{{ }}` to render your favorite framework on build-time.

You will find integration with most frameworks in [saurabhdaware/abell-integrations](https://github.com/saurabhdaware/abell-integrations/tree/main) repository
