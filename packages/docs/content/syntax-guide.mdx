# Syntax Guide

This page explains the syntax of `.abell` files

## JS-in-HTML Syntax

In `.abell` files you can write JavaScript code inside the double curly braces.

This code gets evaluated during build-time and the output is injected into HTML.

```abell
<body>{{ 2 + 1 }}</body>
// Outputs: <body>3</body>
```

## Imports

Imports are allowed in the first block of the file. You can import anything that Vite allows you to import.

```abell
{{
  import { add } from './calculate.ts';
}}

<body>{{ add(2, 1) }}</body>
```

You can also extend the type of files you can import using Vite Plugins. E.g. You can use [vite-plugin-md-to-html](https://github.com/saurabhdaware/vite-plugin-md-to-html) to use `.md` imports

## Declarations

In Abell, you can mark a block as declaration block using `/** @declarations */` comment

```abell
{{
  /** @declarations */
  const a = 3;
  const b = 9;
}}
<body>{{ a + b }}</body>
```

<details>
<summary>This is required because in JavaScript, assignments return values which abell might try to print unless `/** @declarations */` comment is used</summary>

By default Abell tries to print the output of expression inside Abell block. Which means sometimes the default behaviour might be unexpected. E.g. -

```abell
{{
  let a;
  a = 4;
}}
<body>{{ a }}</body>

// Outputs - "4<body>4</body>"
```

This is because in JavaScript, the assignment operator returns the value as well which Abell will try to print unless `/** @declarations */` comment is used

</details>

## Loops & Conditions

You can use `.map` to loop over array. You can also ternary operators for any conditions.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: editor(loopsAndConditions) }} />

But... What if I hate writing `.map`? or using ternary operators in complex conditions?

## Immediately Invoked Function Expressions

If you write a function in abell block, It automatically gets invoked with empty params.

Which means if you don't like writing `.map` or using ternary operators, You can write the good old `For` loops or `if-else` conditions inside function and return the value you want to print.

<div
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: editor(immediatelyInvokedFunctions) }}
/>

## Components

Abell has native component support. It allows you to make your HTML, CSS code reusable.

You can define component starting with `_` to tell abell to not create a page of it in final output. You can also opt-out of this `_` rule (and file-system routing) by using [Custom Routing](/custom-routing).

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: editor(componentsUsage) }} />
<br />

### Passing Props

Whenever you import a `.abell` file, it returns a javascript function that can render the HTML.

The first argument you pass to this function can be read from variable `props` in the imported file.

E.g.

```abell
<!-- index.abell -->
{{
  import greet from './greet.abell';
}}
<body>
  {{ greet({ msg: 'Abell is here!!' }) }}
</body>
```

Now we can read the `msg` with `props.msg` in `greet.abell` file

```abell
<!-- greet.abell -->

<h2>{{ props.msg }}</h2>
<!-- Outputs: <h2>Abell is here!!</h2> -->
```
